# FAIR-Attribution-Method v1.1

**Author:** Eytan Ellenberg MD MPH PhD  
**Affiliation:** Research Office, Medical Affairs, National Insurance Institute of Israel  
**License:** CC BY 4.0  
**Release Date:** October 2025  

---

## üìò Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of the **FAIR framework**  
(*Filtering evidence, Association quantification, Individual partitioning, Reasoned interpretation*).  
FAIR provides a structured and transparent methodology for **individual causal attribution** in occupational medicine.

Version 1.1 corresponds to the manuscript submitted to  
**_Occupational Medicine (Oxford University Press)_**, October 2025.

FAIR 1.1 includes:
- Deterministic Shapley allocation of excess risk (standard FAIR)
- **Monte Carlo FAIR** module for stochastic uncertainty propagation
- Conceptual **causal Shapley extension** (Heskes 2020)
- Fully auditable, open-source R workflow compliant with FAIR data principles

## üî¨ Methodological background

| Step | Purpose | Core methods |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **F ‚Äì Filtering evidence** | Systematic selection and bias appraisal (OHAT) | Exclusion of high-risk meta-analyses |
| **A ‚Äì Association quantification** | Extraction of adjusted RR/OR and baseline risk (p‚ÇÄ) | Conversion OR ‚Üí RR (Zhang & Yu 1998) |
| **I ‚Äì Individual partitioning** | Shapley value allocation of excess risk | Game-theoretic fairness (efficiency, symmetry, additivity) |
| **R ‚Äì Reasoned interpretation** | Expert contextualization and iterative refinement | Clinical, anatomical, and latency plausibility checks |

Future extensions (FAIR‚ÄìSQS) combine **causal Shapley [Heskes 2020]** with **Monte Carlo** simulation to model correlated exposures.

Output interpretation

RAI (Individual Attributable Risk): estimated share of disease risk due to exposure.

Shapley share: proportion of total excess risk attributed fairly among exposures.

FAI ‚Üî R cycle: iterative re-computation after new information or expert reassessment.

üßÆ Validation & transparency

All data = public meta-analytic or registry sources

OHAT scoring sheets ‚Üí Annex 1

Code and Monte Carlo outputs ‚Üí Annex 2

Reproducibility tested on 10 000 simulations / case
